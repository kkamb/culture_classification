# culture classification

<a href="https://github.com/kkamb/culture_classification/blob/master/classification_example.ipynb">This notebook</a> contains code written during a presentation on building a Python sentiment analysis classifier in 15 minutes. It is a very stripped-down version of what your eventual code should be, but can prove a useful starting point/template. Also, when it comes to these problems, ensure that you have a good training set; the more training data points the better.
